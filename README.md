# Pete

Pete is an open source alternative to [PEAT](https://trace.umd.edu/peat/) (Photosensitive Epilepsy Analysis Tool).

Pete is a free, downloadable tool for analyzing video files and identifying seizure risks in them. The analysis is based on the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, guideline 2.3.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#three-flashes), with a [correction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Relative_luminance) to the relative luminance formula.

In this repository resides the main engine. It can't be run on its own, it's only to be included as a submodule.
